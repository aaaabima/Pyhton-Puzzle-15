# Pyhton-Puzzle-15

This is my Computer Graphics mini project. I made this using ATM (Amati, Tiru, Modifikasi) so not all of the code are made by myself. I modify some of the methods which needed to show image. Modification i made is the photo of the Candi Borobudur so it has Indonesia vibe to it.  I also added a modern Gamelan Jawa as background music while you play the game.
